👀 I’m interested in time-series analysis and predictions, natural language processing, large language models, and deep learning. In my current role, I am working on developing AI agents to solve complex business problems.
<br>
🌱 I believe in continuous learning and exploration! Recently, I completed some trainings on usage of TensorFlow and Neural Networks for prediction and analysis.
